# Data Analysis Weather 
Analyse local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends of a city to overall global temperature trends.


### Steps:
- Extract data from a database using a SQL query: 
1. Write a SQL query to extract the city level data from the `city_lits` table to an CSV 
2. Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV


- Calculate a moving average (in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable) and create a line chart that compares local temperatures with the global temperatures.


- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your cityâ€™s averages, as well as overall trends.
