# Data Analysis Weather 
Analyse local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends of a city to overall global temperature trends.

### Steps:
- Extract data from a database using a SQL query: 
  1) Write a SQL query to extract the city level data from the `city_lits` table to an CSV 
  2) Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV
- Calculate a moving average and create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures, in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
